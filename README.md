# EXERCISE-TRACKER-MERN-STACK
Simple Exercise Tracking App built using Mern Stack

This is a react based app that uses **MongoDb Atlas** for storing various user details directly onto the cloud server.
All the **CRUD operations** are available in the Exercise log and the main page shows a display of all the logged exercises.

The app provides options for entering a new user or adding details of an exercise for an existing user.

I created this projected as a first step towards my journey in **MERN stack development** and it really fascinates me how fast it is in terms of implementation and working.
